## üìÑ `setup.sql`

Run this script in your Supabase SQL Editor to initialize the database.

```sql
-- Drop existing tables in reverse order of dependency to avoid errors
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS sets;
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS workout_sessions;
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS exercises;

-- Create the exercises table
CREATE TABLE exercises (
    id BIGINT PRIMARY KEY GENERATED ALWAYS AS IDENTITY,
    name TEXT NOT NULL UNIQUE,
    muscle_group TEXT NOT NULL,
    created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT now() NOT NULL
);

-- Create the workout_sessions table
CREATE TABLE workout_sessions (
    id BIGINT PRIMARY KEY GENERATED ALWAYS AS IDENTITY,
    date DATE NOT NULL,
    created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT now() NOT NULL
);

-- Create the sets table
CREATE TABLE sets (
    id BIGINT PRIMARY KEY GENERATED ALWAYS AS IDENTITY,
    workout_session_id BIGINT REFERENCES workout_sessions(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    exercise_id BIGINT REFERENCES exercises(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    set_number INT NOT NULL,
    weight NUMERIC,
    reps INT,
    volume NUMERIC GENERATED ALWAYS AS (weight * reps) STORED,
    created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT now() NOT NULL
);

-- Insert initial exercises
